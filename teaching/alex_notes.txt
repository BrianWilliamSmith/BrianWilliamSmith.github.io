# Model evaluation and goals

- How to evaluate and diagnose the model
	- What's the baseline model?
	- What are goals? (statistical evaluation)

# Learning algorithm and training

- Read about outlier detection
	- ML outlier detection?
	- Backward/forward model selection
		- [helpful slides on model selection: BIC vs. AIC vs. LRT](http://sct.uab.cat/estadistica/sites/sct.uab.cat.estadistica/files/uab_june_2017.pdf)
		- [overview of backward and forward selection](http://gerardnico.com/data_mining/stepwise_regression)
		- Stephanie Shih — backward model selection for exceptionality
	- Link: [towards data science article on outlier detection](http://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-overview-of-outlier-detection-techniques-1e0b2c19e561)
		- point outliers -- speech error, error
		- contextual outliers -- noise
		- collective outliers -- unaccounted for variance
- How to fit hyper parameters?
	- Use validation set to determine [hyper parameters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning))?


# Constraints and data specifically for French project

- Constraint set
	- 6 or 7 constraints is upper limit of practical
		- *schwa
		- *CCC (recalculate)
		- *Max-schwa
		- *gn+C (reconsider?)
		- *[CC (reconsider?)
	- Sonority
		- two types of clusters?
		- Marie-Hélène Côté (2000)?
		- Aaron Kaplan (2015)?
	- Morphology (epenthesis vs. deletion)
		- look at subset of data, controlling for influence of morphology
- Data for French project (model input)
	- Frequency calculation
	- Two data sets?
		- Balanced <- type frequency
		- Realistically <- token frequency
