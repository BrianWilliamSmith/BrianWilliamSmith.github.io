# Model evaluation and goals

- How to evaluate and diagnose the model
	- What's the baseline model?
	- What are goals? (statistical evaluation)

# Learning algorithm and training

- Read about outlier detection
	- ML outlier detection?
	- Forward model selection?
	- Stephanie Shih — backward model selection for exceptionality
- Read up on outlier detection in ML
	- point outliers -- speech error, error
	- contextual outliers -- noise
	- collective outliers -- unaccounted for variance

- Use validation set

# Constraints and data specifically for French project

- Constraint set
	- 6 or 7 constraints is upper limit of practical
		- *schwa
		- *CCC (recalculate)
		- *Max-schwa
		- *gn+C (reconsider?)
		- *[CC (reconsider?)
	- Sonority
		- two types of clusters?
		- Marie-Hélène Côté (2000)?
		- Aaron Kaplan (2015)?
	- Morphology (epenthesis vs. deletion)
		- look at subset of data, controlling for influence of morphology
- Data for French project (model input)
	- Frequency calculation
	- Two data sets
		Balanced <- type frequency
		- Realistically <- token frequency
