<h1 id="recall:justifyingconstraints">Recall: justifying constraints</h1>

<ul>
<li>There are three ways to justify a constraint:

<ul>
<li><strong>Formal</strong>: resembles other constraints in CON.</li>
<li><strong>Functional</strong>: reflects articulation, perception, or memory.

<ul>
<li>Examples: Agree, Ident-Onset[Voice]</li>
<li>Potentially includes audience design</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Typological</strong>: its cross-linguistic typological predictions are borne out.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Today we&#8217;ll tackle functional justification.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="phoneticsvs.phonology">Phonetics vs. phonology</h1>

<ul>
<li>Widespread assumptions about the generative grammar (see e.g. Steriade 1997, who argues against this model, and Hayes 1999 who assumes it)

<ul>
<li>There is a phonological component of the model

<ul>
<li>Determines which sounds contrast and where</li>
<li>Manipulates phonological representations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is a phonetic component of the model

<ul>
<li>Maps phonological representations onto articulatory instructions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These two models are separate, but the phonological model feeds the phonetic model.

<ul>
<li>The interaction is &#8220;one-way&#8221; (feedforward with no feedback) &#8211; phonology doesn&#8217;t consider physical factors directly, although phonological processes are possibly shaped (over time?) by functional considerations and phonetic &#8220;naturalness.&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are some processes that seem unambiguously phonological (see Kenstowicz &amp; Kissberth 1978, Ch 2: The Nonphonetic Basis of Phonology for examples).

<ul>
<li>They refer to grammatical or lexical information.

<ul>
<li>For example, they refer to syntactic categories.</li>
<li>For example, they are sensitive to morpheme boundaries.</li>
<li>For example, they have morphological or lexical exceptions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They aren&#8217;t phonetically natural, usually due to historical change.

<ul>
<li>Telescoping: multiple sound changes &#8211; each of which is natural &#8211; results in an phonetically unmotivated synchronic alternation.</li>
<li>Inversion: e.g., a phonetically natural rule of deletion is reanalyzed as a rule of epenthesis.</li>
<li>Paradigm leveling and analogy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These assume phonetic rules don&#8217;t refer to boundaries or lexical information, which now seems wrong, at with respect to prosodic boundaries and item-specific phonetics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Both components &#8211; phonetic and phonological &#8211; can generate very similar looking processes.

<ul>
<li>Sometimes a phonetic process becomes <strong>phonologized</strong>, wherein the phonetic process becomes a phonological process.</li>
<li>Here are some examples from Hyman (2013) of processes that can either be phonetic or phonological, depending on the language.</li>
<li>If the triggering environment disappears due to a sound change, the phonetic conditioning is lost, and the process is unambigously phonological (maybe even resulting in contrast).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>How do we determine what&#8217;s phonetic and what&#8217;s phonological if it&#8217;s like one of the processes above?

<ul>
<li>This isn&#8217;t as easy as you might think…</li>
<li>Here are some characteristic differences from Hyman (2013), who cites: Cohn 1998, 2007; Keating 1996; Keyser and Stevens 2001; Kingston 2007; Pierrehumbert 1990; Stevens and Keyser 1989, etc.</li>
<li>Both phonology and phonetics seem to be language-specific to some degree.</li>
<li>Both phonology and phonetics seem to be subject to optionality to some degree.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Two traditional diagnostics from Hyman (2013). A process has been phonologized if…</p>

<ul>
<li>A phonetic effect is exaggerated beyond what can be considered universal (e.g. duration increases more than we&#8217;d expect)</li>
<li>A ‘categorical’ rule of phonology refers to it. (e.g. a clearly phonological process refers to vowel length, than that length must be phonological)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Another view is that phonetics and phonology should not be treated in a simple feed-forward modular framework.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead, phonology can <em>refer directly</em> to phonetic characteristics, beyond just features. Both take very seriously the idea of functionally motivated constraints.</li>
<li>Two papers today:

<ul>
<li>Hayes (1999): A feedforward model, except for the induction of phonological constraints. Learning constraints involves a tradeoff between increasing ease of articulation and minimizing complexity.</li>
<li>Steriade (2001): Complicated typological patterns in assimilation can be explained by appealing to ease of perception and confusability.</li>
<li>Both papers use maps of difficulty: one for articulation (Hayes) andd one for perception (Steriade).</li>

<ul>
<li>Questions for discussion:

<ul>
<li>What are the main goals of the paper?</li>
<li>What factors influence the ease of voicing in obstruents?

<ul>
<li>Let&#8217;s go over them and discuss how and why.</li>
<li>What about sonorants?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Where does the map of articulatory difficulty come from?</li>
<li>How is the map used to induce constraints?</li>
<li>Under Hayes' model, to what extent is CON universal?</li>
<li>Does Hayes' model address the too-many-repairs problem?</li>
<li>What constraints (if any) have we talked about that couldn&#8217;t be induced under the algorithm presented here?</li>
</ul></li>
