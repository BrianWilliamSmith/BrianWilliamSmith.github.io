# Introduction and Review

{{TOC}}

## Course overview
- This course is about phonological theories, especially evaluating, comparing, and applying them. We're going to be focusing primarily on Optimality Theory, a framework that emerged in the early 1990s and replaced rules with constraints.
-	Plan
	-   Syllabus, Slack, Google docs, and you.
	-   This handout. Note: handouts will usually span multiple class meetings; this handout is exceptionally long and detailed.
	-   Think of an answer to...
		-   "What are other possible goals of phonological theory?"
		-   "What are phonological data?"

## Generative phonology
- The central premise of Generative Grammar is that linguistic knowledge consists of both a **grammar** and a **lexicon**.
- The lexicon contains all unpredictable information about words/morphemes, including their underlying representations (URs).
	-   Working assumption #1: every morpheme has exactly one UR.
	-   Working assumption #2: URs are built solely of sounds from a language's phoneme inventory.
- The grammar is a process or algorithm that takes URs and derives Surface Representations (SRs). The grammar captures all predictable information.
	-   Entailment of working assumption #1: if a morpheme has different SRs, differences between those SRs are derived via the grammar.
- The process of generating SRs from URs is a **derivation**.

Lexicon  | Grammar (simplified) | Surface forms
| - | - | - |
/bræg/+/d/ 	| make /d/ voiceless after a voiceless segment	| [brægd]
/hæk/+/d/  	| make /d/ voiceless after a voiceless segment	| [hækt]
/su/+/d/  	| make /d/ voiceless after a voiceless segment	| [sud]
[Example of a derivation]

-	The grammar and lexicon together result in a set UR-SR mappings, a.k.a. input-output mappings:
	-   /bræg+d/ → [brægd]
	-   /hæk+d/ → [hækt]
	-   /su+d/ → [sud]
	-   etc.
-	No matter whether you have rules or constraints:
	-  	A generative grammar conceives of language as a process or algorithm that generates all possible SRs from a set of URs, which can be concatenated in various ways.
	-   A generative grammar has three major design goals:
		- 	Be parsimonious: make the algorithm as simple and general as possible. 
		-  	Don't undergenerate: ensure that all of the possible forms of a language are possible outputs of the grammar.
		-  	Don't overgenerate: ensure that none of the impossible forms are generated by mistake. 

## Productivity
-	An important feature: we can apply the grammar to novel words, just like kids and adults do.

	Lexicon | Grammar (simplified)| Surface forms
	 -- | -- | --
	/tiʧ/+/d/	| make /d/ voiceless after a voiceless segment	| [tiʧt]
	/go/+/d/	| make /d/ voiceless after a voiceless segment 	| [god]
	/rɪk/+/d/	| make /d/ voiceless after a voiceless segment 	| [rɪkt]
[Applying devoicing to novel words]

-	A grammatical process's **productivity** in a particular language is a measure of…
	- The extent to which the process is applied to existing words.
	- The capacity of the process to apply in novel circumstances.
-	The fact that speakers can apply processes to words they've never heard before, where memorization is impossible, supports the claim that speakers have internalized the grammatical processes of their language.
	- This argument is so important that Chomsky (1980) gave it a name: poverty of the stimulus.

## Phonemes and allophones.
-	Every language has a limited set of **phonemes**. A phoneme is a label for a set of sounds that are basically the same (more on this below). 
-	The variants of a phoneme are called **allophones**. 
-	Allophonic variation is often structured and predictable based on phonological context.
	- English /l/
		- [l] in syllable onsets *(leaf)*
		- [ɫ] in syllable codas *(feel)*
	- American English /t/
		- [tʰ] before V́ *(time)*
		- [ʔt] in syllable codas *(cat)*
		- [ɾ] between vowels *(city)*
		- [ʧ] before \[r\] *(tree)*
		- [t] elsewhere *(sty)*
- When there are multiple allophones of a phoneme, the form of the phoneme usually matches one of the allophones.
	 - One of the forms is "basic." 
	 - The other forms are derived via the grammar.
-	Notation
	 - Phonemes get slashes (e.g. /t/).
	 - Allophones get square brackets (e.g. [t]).
- Contrast and predictability
	 - Phonemes are contrastive and unpredictable. 
		 - Two sounds are contrastive/distinctive if the difference between them is meaningful: substitution of one for the other can lead to a new word.
		 - Unpredictable: "I have a new English word that rhymes with winter, does it begin with a t or l?"
	 - Allophones are usually non-contrastive and predictable.
		- Predictable: "I have a new English word that rhymes with winter, does it begin with [l] or [ɫ]?"
		- If the allophones are unpredictable, that's **free variation**.
- Phonemes and allophones are psychologically real to some degree.
	- Language users often "feel" that two sounds count the same.
	- Language users often have trouble distinguishing between allophones of the same phoneme, especially when learning a new language where the difference is contrastive.
	- Writing systems and transcriptions in introductory linguistics courses are usually phonemic.
- We assume that every UR in a language consists solely of the phonemes of that language.
	- This is why URs are also called phonemic representations.





##	Alternations and phonotactics
-	We can talk about **morphemes** and **allomorphs** just as we talk about phonemes and allophones.
	 - When a morpheme has multiple surface variants (allomorphs), we call the pattern an **alternation**.
	 - Terminology examples:
		- "In English, the plural morpheme alternates between [z] and [s]"
	 	- "In the English plural, [z] alternates with [s]"
		- "The English plural shows the alternation [z] ~ [s]"
- Alternations are often contrasted with **phonotactics**, static restrictions on the distribution of sounds.
	- Examples:
		- "English words cannot end in lax vowels, except [ə], [ɔ] and [ɑ]"
		- "Lax vowels in English cannot be immediately followed by a vowel" 
	- Some (but not all) phonotactics result in alternations. 
	- Most (but not all) alternations are the result of phonotactics.

##	Distributions and phonemic analysis
-	**Phonemic analysis** is a method of phonological analysis that explores the contextual distribution of segments within a language.
	 - Essentially, decide how to group the sounds into phonemes. 
	 - In the first half of the twentieth century, phonemic analysis was the goal of pre-generative Structuralists like Edward Sapir.
		- The Structuralist view of phonemes and allophones differs from the one here: there were no underlying forms or generative grammars.
		- According to Structuralist phonemic analysis, there was always a perfectly predictable mapping between phonemes and allophones. This isn't always obtainable.

##	Minimal pairs and near-minimal pairs
-	A **minimal pair** is a pair of words that differ in meaning and exactly one sound.
-	Here are some English words with various vowels. 
	- We can conclude some of these vowels belong to different phonemes.
	- Walk through the argument carefully. (What assumptions does it rely on?)

| --- | --- | --- | ---|
|[ˈsut]	|'suit'	|[ˈpʌt]	|'putt'	|
|[ˈʃɪn]	|'shin'	|[ˈʃɪp]	|'ship'	|
|[ˈʃɪp]	|'ship'	|[ˈbut]	|'boot'	|
|[ˈpʊt]	|'put'	|[ˈʃin]	|'sheen'|
|[ˈsʊt]	|'soot' |[ˈbʌt]	|'butt'	|
[Some English words]

- What if we can't find minimal pairs for two sounds? (e.g. [ʃ] and [ʒ] in English)
	- Answer: look for **near-minimal pairs**

##	Complementary distribution
-	If two sounds occur in complementary environments (are in **complementary distribution**) then they may be allophones of the same phoneme.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|[ˈnoʊ]		|'know'		| [ˈtɛn̪θ]		| 'tenth'		|		
|[əˈnoɪ]	|'annoy'	| [ˈmʌn̪θ]		| 'month'		|		
|[ˈʌnjən]	|'onion'	| [ˈpæn̪θɚ]		| 'panther'		|	
|[ˈnʌn]		|'nun'		| [krəˈsæn̪θəməm]	| 'chrysanthemum'	|	
[English example of [n] and dental [n] from Bruce Hayes' Introductory Phonology textbook]

## More practice
1. In English, are [l] and [d] allophones of the same phoneme or realizations of different phonemes?
2. Propose a phonemic analysis for [l] and [d] in Setswana, also known as Tswana, a Niger-Congo language from Botswana with about 4.5 million speakers.

|---|---|---|---|
|[lefifi]	|'darkness'		|[loleme]	|'tongue'	|
|[selɛpɛ]	|'axe'			|[molɔmo]	|'mouth'	|	
|[xobala]	|'to read'		|[mmadi]	|'reader'	|	
|[lerumɔ]	|'spear'		|[xoɲala]	|'to marry'	|	
|[loxadima]	|'lightning flash'	|[diʤɔ]		|'food'		|	
|[dumɛla]	|'greetings'		|[feedi]	|'sweeper'	|	
|[lokwalɔ]	|'letter'		|[kʰudu]	|'tortoise'	|	
|[mosadi]	|'woman'		|[podi]		|'goat'		|	
|[badisa]	|'the herd'		|[hudi]		|'wild duck'	|	
[Setswana problem from Odden (2005)]

- Important point to remember: whether two sounds are different phonemes or allophones of the same phoneme depends on the language.
- Another good example is how English and Spanish divide up the sounds [ɾ], [d], [ð]:
	- English [ɾ]~[d] vs. [ð]
	- Spanish [ɾ] vs. [d]~[ð]

## Limitations of the flowchart
- There are three places where flowchart thinking needs tweaking.
	- If two sounds are in complementary distribution they may be allophones of the same phoneme, but they aren't necessarily so.
	- **Contextually-limited contrast** is a case where different phonemes share an allophone. In that allophone's environment, there's no surface contrast between the phonemes. (see t/d above)
	- If there is a minimal pair, we can only conclude that there's some difference between the Urs of the two words. It's not necessarily the case that the differing sound is what's contrastive.
- Based on these, together with free variation, it becomes clearer why a perfectly predictable mapping between phonemes and allophones is unobtainable.

## Complementary distribution, revisited
-	Two sounds in complementary distribution may be allophones of the same phoneme.
- In what environments do you find [l]? [ɫ̪]?

|---|---|---|---|
|[ˈlɪsən]	|'listen'	|[ˈwɛɫ̪θ]	|'wealth'	
|[ˈluz]		|'lose'		|[ˈhɛɫ̪θ]	|'health'	
|[əˈlaʊ]	|'allow'	|[ˈfɪɫ̪θi]	|'filthy'	
|[əˈɡloʊ]	|'aglow'	|[ˈtɪɫ̪θ]	|'tilth'	
|[ˈblɛnd]	|'blend'	|[ˈstɛɫ̪θ]	|'stealth'	|	
[ [l] and dental [l] from Bruce Hayes' introductory phonology textbook ]

- Are [n] and [ɫ̪] in complementary distribution? [l] and [n̪]?

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|[ˈnoʊ]		|'know'	|[ˈtɛn̪θ]	|'tenth'	
|[əˈnoɪ]	|'annoy'|[ˈmʌn̪θ]	|'month'	
|[ˈʌnjən]	|'onion'|[ˈpæn̪θɚ]	|'panther'	
|[ˈnʌn]		|'nun'	|[krəˈsæn̪θəməm]	|'chrysanthemum'	|
[ [n] and dental [n]]

- Also consider English [h] and [ŋ].
- What does this mean for our algorithm of phonemic analysis?

## Positional neutralization / contextually-limited contrast
- **Positional neutralization** occurs when an underlying contrast between two phonemes disappears in a certain environment. In that position, the contrast is neutralized.
- This is also called **contextually-limited contrast**, since the contrast is limited to a particular (non-neutralizing) context.

|[bæt]|	'bat'	|[bæɾɚ]	|'batter'	| 	| 		|[bæɾɪŋ]|'batting'
|[sæd]|	'sad'	|[sæɾɚ]	|'sadder'	|[sæɾəst]|'saddest'	| 	|

|[wɛd]|	'wed'	|	| 		|	| 		|[wɛɾɪŋ]|'wedding'	|
[/t/, /d/ and tapping]
					
- Another example: English nasals
	- /n/ optionally assimilates to the place of articulation of the following segment
	- The prefix *in-*
		- [n] inaccessible, intolerant	
		- [m] impossible
		- [ŋ] inconsolable
	- The word *phone*
		- [n] phone, phone number 		
		- [m] phone book
		- [ŋ] phone cord
	- Contrast: foam ≠ phone
	- Positional neutralization: foam book = phone book
	- But: /ŋ/ is always [ŋ].
		- [ŋ] not [n]: ringtone (≠ ri[n]tone)
		- [ŋ] not [m]: songbook (≠ so[m]book)
	- A relatively complicated phonemicization.

## Minimal pairs, revisited (displaced contrast)
- Based on the data below, do [aɪ] and [ʌɪ] contrast in this dialect of English, or are they allophones of the same phoneme (if so, describe their distribution)?

| -- | -- | -- | -- |
|[ˈlʌɪk]	|[ˈʤaɪb]	|[ˈklaɪm] 	|[ˈraɪð]
|[ˈflʌɪt]	|[ˈtɹʌɪp]	|[ˈʃaɪn]	|[ˈwaɪd]
|[ˈsnʌɪp]	|[ˈlʌɪf]	|[ˈbaɪ]		|[əˈblaɪʤ]
|[ˈlaɪv]	|[ˈʌɪs]		|[ˈspaɪ]	|[ˈsaɪd]	|
[ [aɪ] and [ʌɪ] in speakers from the Mid-Atlantic Region, New England, and Canada]

- This process interacts with tapping.

| -- | -- | -- |
|[ˈrʌɪt]	|[ˈrʌɪɾɚ]	|'writer'
|[ˈraɪd]	|[ˈraɪɾɚ]	|'rider'
|[ˈslaɪd]	|[ˈslaɪɾɪŋ]	|'sliding'
|[ˈslʌɪt]	|[ˈslʌɪɾɪŋ]	|'slighting'|
[Tapping and Canadian raising]

- Now looking at the second set of data, would you conclude that [aɪ] and [ʌɪ] are contrastive in this dialect?
- [ˈɹʌɪɾɚ] and [ˈɹaɪɾɚ] are pronounced differently, because their underlying forms are different.
	- What is the contrast between their underlying forms?
	- In one sense, the underlying contrast has been neutralized, but in another sense, the underlying contrast can still be seen, because of its effects on another rule.
	- So, we can say that the underlying contrast between the phonemes /t/ and /d/ has been **displaced** onto the allophones [aɪ] and [ʌɪ] of the phoneme /aɪ/.
- What does this mean for our algorithm of phonemic analysis?
	- If two different words' surface forms are exactly the same except for one sound, we previously concluded that means those two sounds come from different phonemes.
	- But really, all we can conclude is that there is some difference between the underlying forms.
	- Moral: it's safest to start by looking at monomorphemic words, since any minimal contrasts there probably come from exactly the sounds that differ.

| Type | Phonemic analysis |  Predictable? | Contrast? | What to look for|
| --- | -- | ----- | --- | --- | ---
| Contrast | multiple phonemes  | unpredictable | contrastive| (near-)minimal pairs
| Allophony</br> (that isn't free variation) | multiple allophones </br>(predictable) | predictable|non-contrastive| complementary distribution</br>& alternations
| Positional</br>neutralization | multiple phonemes </br> that share an allophone | predictable (partially) | contrastive </br>(contextually-limited)| (near-)minimal pairs </br>& alternations

[Table for phonemic analysis]

- A final note: terminology can be confusing, making tables and flowcharts imperfect.
	- Remember that contrast and allophony can co-occur (e.g. positional neutralization). 
	- Also, predictabiliy and allophony don't always go together (e.g. free variation).
	- In common usage, the term *allophony* usually implies that the pattern isn't positional neutralization or free variation, but allophony is technically present in both.
	

## Goals of phonology and phonological data
-	Repeated from above:
	- A generative grammar conceives of language as a process or algorithm that generates all possible SRs from a set of URs, which can be concatenated in various ways.
	- A generative grammar has three major design goals:
		- Be parsimonious: make the algorithm as simple and general as possible. 
		- Don't undergenerate: ensure that all of the possible forms of a language are possible outputs of the grammar.
		- Don't overgenerate: ensure that none of the impossible forms are generated by mistake. 
-	What are other possible goals?
-	Phonologists rarely disagree about the goals, but often disagree on the specifics:
	- How do we decide what's possible/impossible in a language? This is especially relevant for exceptions and gaps.
	- What counts as data? What about judgments? Corpus data? Language games?
	- What does it mean for an algorithm to be simple or general? Is it fewer symbols? Shorter running time? Better performance on new data?
	- Which design goal(s) should be prioritized?
	- Should the algorithm be abstract or grounded in human cognition?
	- Relatedly: do we want the grammar to model knowledge of what's grammatical (linguistic competence) or mimic actual human performance?
	- A clear example of the last question: do we want our model to generate humanlike speech errors?
