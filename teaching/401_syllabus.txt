# Overview

**Prerequisites:** Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology (Ling 301)

This course is about phonological theory development and argumentation: how formal phonological models are evaluated and revised in order to meet empirical and conceptual goals. We focus in particular on constraint-based frameworks, especially Optimality Theory (OT: Prince and Smolensky 1993/2004), which is the major competitor to rule-based frameworks in the tradition of Chomsky and Halle’s (1968) Sound Pattern of English. We discuss OT’s motivations, its formal architecture, some of its results, and some of its shortcomings. OT makes predictions about phonological typology, and this course involves data from many familiar and unfamiliar languages, especially regarding syllabification, stress, and reduplication.

When this course is completed, you should:
- be able to find generalizations in a data set and describe phonological patterns in relatively theory-neutral terms,
- be able to formulate analyses in OT and understand the predictions that they make,
- be able to argue effectively for a given analysis (especially able to justify constraints),
- be able to read and interpret original research in OT, 
- have begun to develop your own research project that makes use of the concepts discussed in class.

# Materials

## Textbooks and handouts
- There are two required textbooks
	- *Doing Optimality Theory* by John J. McCarthy (2008).
	- *Optimality Theory* by René Kager (1999)
- Handouts are posted on my website for [USC Advanced Undergraduate Phonology](401_guide.html).
- Readings are downloadable at a private link I've shared via Slack. Please don't share this link. 

## Electronic device policy
- Please bring your charged laptop to class. Throughout the semester, we’ll collaborate using Google Docs and Slack.
- However, I ask that outside of these activities, you minimize your electronic device usage, restricting it to accessing readings or taking notes.
	- Use of electronic devices during class can serve as a distraction not only to you, but also to others.
	- Please silence phones and stow them during class. Texts, emails, web browsing and so on, can wait until afterwards.
	- Your respect for this policy is appreciated – it makes a real difference to the classroom environment as a whole. 
- My personal advice is to take handwritten notes and focus on the handout. 
	- Studies seem to agree that handwritten notes result in better recall and increased focus, relative to typed notes.  

# Requirements

## Class participation
- This is the most important requirement.
- Our collective goal is to get everyone talking roughly the same amount. 
- Time is not an issue: the goal is to develop skills – not cover any particular material.

## Reading comments
- You are required to post (on Slack) one short question or comment per class on the assigned reading, unless an assignment or presentation is due that day.
- The goal is to encourage you to do the readings and give you practice critically engaging with phonology. 
- See the course website for ideas about types of comments or questions you can write. One to three sentences is sufficient and ideal, and a single one-sentence question is all I expect.
- The deadline is the night before class.
- There is overlap between the two textbooks, which means that sometimes you will read things you already know. This is a good thing! The two textbooks may contradict each other in small ways. This is not uncommon at this level.

## Opt-out office hours
- Since the class is small, I’m going to schedule a weekly 20-30 minute meeting with each of you.
- You can use this time to discuss the final paper, class material, additional readings, or whatever else you’d like to
- You can always opt out: if you’d like to skip a meeting, just e-mail me the night before. 

## Weekly quizzes
- Quizzes help you assess your comprehension of assigned readings and class material.
- They are intended to be relatively easy if you’ve been following the material.
- There is quiz every Monday, 12:30pm–12:45pm.
- The lowest two quiz grades are dropped. If you miss class due to illness or an emergency, you can make up a quiz, but only if you provide documentation.
- Quizzes are graded on a 0–5 scale:
	- 0  (didn't complete)	
	- 1–2 (serious misunderstanding of material — major mistakes)
	- 3  (some understanding — many small mistakes)
	- 4  (thorough understanding — a few small mistakes)
	- 5  (absolutely perfect in every way — no improvement possible)


## Five or six homework assignments
- These provide hands-on practice with analysis, argumentation, and applying, extending and revising theories.
- Think of them as mini-papers.
- You are encouraged to collaborate with others, but you must write up and submit your own solution, listing anyone with whom you collaborated.
- Submit hard copies at the beginning of class on the due date.
- Assignments are returned in class within seven days of submission.
- Submitted assignments should not contain text, figures, tables, and so on that have been copied electronically or otherwise from another student or any other source.
	- Quotations or other forms of reference to other work are of course acceptable with the appropriate citations.
	- USC takes academic integrity very seriously and enforces it strictly.
	- You can read more at [Academic Conduct][].
	- If you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism or cheating, please come and see me.


## A final paper 
- Your goal is to demonstrate all of the skills you’ve developed in class.
- The aims of the paper are threefold:
	1. To show your ability to describe and analyze a set of data.
	2. To apply techniques of current theory.
	3. To effectively argue for your proposed account.
- In the paper, you will:
	- Describe a phonological pattern from some language in theory-neutral terms, using data from a grammar, dissertation, or published paper (including proceedings papers).
	- Write an original rule-based analysis of the pattern.
	- Write a constraint-based analysis of the pattern.
	- Compare the rule-based and constraint-based analysis, and argue for one over the other.
- “Original” analysis?
	- I don’t require you to read everything written on the topic, or even other OT analyses of the phenomenon. 
	- This means you might inadvertently replicate an existing analysis, which is okay.
	- However, if you want to use this paper as a writing sample for graduate school, originality and thoroughness are important.
- Paper timeline:
	- Select a proposed topic and meet with me for approval of the topic by November 13.
	- Submit a 1–2 page outline of your paper proposal by November 20. Your proposal should summarize the key aspects of the data/problem that you are interested in investigating. 
	- Present your paper in class on December 4 with a handout (and slides if you would like) outlining your analysis.
	- Submit a written version of the research paper that takes into account comments received during your presentation. The paper will probably be about 8–15 pages (double-spaced), including data and references.
	- The paper is due Wednesday December 11th at 1pm. No late papers are accepted, barring a student taking an ‘incomplete’ for the class.
