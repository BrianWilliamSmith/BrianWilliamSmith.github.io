<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>

<ul>
<li>The goal of this assignment is to provide practice with crucial rankings, ERCs, ERC fusion, and RCD.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="data">Data</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Lardil data provided via Slack.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h1>

<ul>
<li>Write a handout or slides showing the application of RCD step-by-step.

<ul>
<li>Terse, bullet pointed discussion is acceptable, as long as you do the following:</li>
<li>First, make a comparative tableau and identify all crucial rankings for the Lardil data.

<ul>
<li>You can use ERC fusion to provide crucial rankings.</li>
<li>State these as succinctly as possible, along with support.</li>
<li>Write a hasse diagram, and indicate any ranking information that cannot be represented with a hasse diagram.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second, perform RCD by hand on the data provided.

<ul>
<li>Show every step.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can number or letter the constraints and candidates, and refer to them using these.

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m less interested in the content of the constraints or candidates, andd more interested in your ability to identify crucial rankings andd apply RCD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be sure to include a brief introduction and conclusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Install OT-Help, OTSoft, or OTWorkplace (I can only provide tech support for OT-Help)

<ul>
<li>Perform RCD using your preferred software program.</li>
<li>Include the output of the software program, comparing it to the results of hand-applied RCD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In your slides or handout, briefly discuss at least two cases in which RCD ranks constraints which are not crucially ranked. Explain where this difference comes from.</li>
</ul>
