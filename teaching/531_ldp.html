<h1 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h1>

<ul>
<li>In this presentation, you will:

<ul>
<li>present a set of data that supports claims about the phoneme inventory of a language and that demonstrates an allophonic alternation;</li>
<li>present your own rule-based analysis of the allophonic alternation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You must provide printed handouts or slides for your presentation (6 copies).</li>
<li>You will have 12&#8211;15 minutes for your presentation followed by up to 5 minutes for discussion.</li>
<li>For your presentation, you should not collaborate with other students in the class.</li>
<li>Each of you will develop a data set for a different language.</li>
<li>You must present on a language you haven&#8217;t previously worked on.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Please email by noon on Friday, September 27 to let me know which language you propose to present on.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="datasources">Data sources</h1>

<ul>
<li>Sources of language data include:

<ul>
<li>descriptive grammars</li>
<li>descriptive journal articles</li>
<li>consultation with native speakers of the languages</li>
<li>introspection on a language for which you have native command</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whichever source(s) you use should be cited at the appropriate point (e.g. &#8220;Johnson 2008&#8221;) with the full reference list provided at the end of your handout.

<ul>
<li>If you consult a native speaker or use introspection, you must explain how you collected the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Note: Wikipedia is <em>not</em> an adequate source. You must use vetted scholarly sources.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="topics">Topics</h1>

<ul>
<li>Your presentation should cover the following topics.</li>
<li>Language background

<ul>
<li>the name of the language you are describing</li>
<li>the family to which it belongs</li>
<li>where it is spoken</li>
<li>the approximate number of speakers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inventory

<ul>
<li>An inventory of the phonemes of the language.

<ul>
<li>Present the vowel and consonant inventories separately.</li>
<li>Arrange phonemes in columns according to place of articulation and in rows according to manner of articulation.</li>
<li>Use IPA symbols to represent the phonemes. This may require translating the symbols used in your source into the IPA.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Support your proposed phoneme inventory with minimal pairs or near-minimal pairs, and include glosses.

<ul>
<li>At a minimum, give (near-)minimal pairs for neighboring segments.</li>
<li>For example, if the language has /k, g, x, ɣ/, give minimal pairs for /k/ ~ /g/, /k/ ~ /x/, and /g/ ~ / ɣ/.</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t find a (near-)minimal pair for a given opposition, discuss why you nevertheless posit a contrast.</li>
<li>Be sure to include minimal pairs for both consonants and vowels.</li>
<li>If tones are phonemic, include supporting evidence for that as well.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allophonic alternation

<ul>
<li>Describe at least one allophonic alternation in the language under study.</li>
<li>Give example words showing the alternations, and, as appropriate, where the alternations do not occur.</li>
<li>Discuss the contexts in which the different alternants are found and choose one as basic, justifying your decision.</li>
<li>Where relevant draw on evaluative criteria such as simplicity and phonetic naturalness.</li>
<li>Formulate a rule (or rules) to characterize the alternation using features and rule ordering as appropriate. Provide derivations to illustrate the workings of your account.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve previously worked on a language if you&#8217;ve written a paper (term paper, independent study, article, etc.) on the language. You <em>can</em> write your final paper for this class on the language you choose for your language data presentation. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to body" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
