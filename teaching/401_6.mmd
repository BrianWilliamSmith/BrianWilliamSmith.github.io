# The challenge
- In rule-and-constraint based phonology, to describe a language you need:
    - an ordered list of rules
    - a list of URs (the lexicon)
    - a phoneme inventory
    - maybe restrictions on combinations of segments in URs (called Morpheme Structure Constraint (MSCs))
    - maybe restrictions on the segments allowed in outputs or derivations
        - called "Wellformedness constraints" or "Surface phonetic constraints"
- Some of the restrictions above seem redundant: **the Duplication Problem**.
- In OT, all you have is…
    - a list of URs (the lexicon) 
    - a ranked list of constraints
    - The lack of an underlying alphabet -- or any constraints on the structure of URs -- is a property called **Richness of the Base**.
- So how can we account for which sounds do and don't contrast, without stating the phoneme inventory?
    + How do we state the inventory, generally?
    + This seems potentially problematic given Richness of the Base…
- Probably not surprising: inventories and contrast come solely from constraint ranking.
    - Contrast in OT comes from faithfulness constraints, which preserve contrast in a certain environment.
    - Markedness constraints militate against the faithful realization of inputs containing sounds illicit in a language.

#  Possible patterns of contrast
- No contrast
    - How do we know it when we see it?
- Full contrast
    - How do we know it when we see it?
- Contextually limited contrast
    - How do we know it when we see it?
    - How does this relate to positional neutralization?
- No contrast - free variation
    - How do we know it when we see it?
    - The version of OT we're considering isn't built to model it.
    - EVAL results in a single optimal candidate, or multiple optimal candidates if they have identical violation profiles. [^ Very simplified descriptions of some possibilities (feel free to ask me about any of these privately): free variation comes from ties: obvious but difficult to work out, since constructing a tie often requires ignoring some active constraints; Partially Ordered Constraints (Anttila 1997 et seq): constraints are only partially ordered, and unordered constraints are randomly reordered at evaluation; Stochastic OT (Boersma 2000): constraints are partially ordered on a numerical scale, which is used to randomly generate a ranking at evaluation; MaxEnt Harmonic Grammar (Goldwater & Johnson 2007): constraints are weighted, resulting in every candidate getting a numerical harmony score, which is converted into a probability; Noisy HG: like Stochastic OT, but with weighted constraints; Markedness suppression (Kaplan 2011): violations for designated constraints are ignored at random at evaluation.]

# Complementary distribution between sounds (no contrast)
- Imagine a language where [p] and [b] are in complementary distribution, and allophones of a single phoneme. 
- In rule terms:
    -  /p/ → [b] / V__V    no phoneme /b/
    -  /p/ → [p] elsewhere (since there's no rule)
    -  Why is [b] only between vowels?
    -  Why is [p] everywhere else?
- Translate into OT using:
    - *V[-voice]V     
    - *[+voice,-son]
    - <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ident</span>([voice])
- Assume these inputs
    + /ap/ 'dog' (real word)          
    + /ap+a/ 'dogs' (real word)  
    + /ab/ '?' (hypothetical input)           
    + /ab+a/ '?(plural)' (hypothetical input)                   
-  /p/ and /b/ don't contrast, because the grammar won't let you have a minimal pair.
- What is it about the ranking that makes that so?

# Full contrast between sounds
- Imagine a different language, where /p/ and /b/ are separate phonemes, with no voicing alternations. 
- Same constraints
    - *V[-voice]V
    - *[+voice,-son]
    - <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ident</span>([voice])
- Find the ranking for:
    - /ap/ 'dog'          
    - /ap+a/ 'dogs'           
    - /ab/ 'cat'          
    - /ab+a/ 'cats'           
- /p/ and /b/ contrast fully-you can get a minimal pair in any environment.
- What is it about the ranking that makes that so?

# Contextually-limited contrast (positional neutralization)
- Imagine language with a voicing contrast (phonemes /p/ and /b/), but also intervocalic voicing. 
- In rule terms:
    - /p/ → [b] / V__V
    - /p/ → [p] elsewhere    
    - /b/ → [b] everywhere
- Same constraints
    - *V[-voice]V
    - *[+voice,-son]
    - <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ident</span>([voice])
- Find the ranking for: 
    - /ap/ 'dog'          
    - /ap+a/ 'dogs'           
    - /ab/ 'cat'          
    - /ab+a/ 'cats'           
- /p/ & /b/ contrast in some environments -- but in other environments, you get neutralization.
- What is it about the ranking that makes that so?
- Have we missed any members of the factorial typology for these three constraints?
    + There are 3! rankings -- any other patterns?

# Contextually limited contrast two ways
- Example: coda devoicing (German, Catalan, Russian, etc.)
    + In onsets, obstruents contrast in voicing.
    + That contrast does not occur in coda position.
    + Results in both **positional neutralization** and **contextually-limited contrast**.
- Two approaches in OT:
    + Context-specific markedness constraints
        * Cause neutralization in a particular environment
        * Example: <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">\*Coda-voice</span>
    + Contextually-limited faithfulness constraints
        * Preserve contrast in a particular environment
        * Example: <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ident-onset</span>([voice])

# Contextually-limited contrast as contextual faithfulness
- Beckman (1998) takes another approach to contextually limited contrast
    - She proposes **positional faithfulness constraints**, now standard in OT analyses.
    - Contrast is preserved in a context X because a faithfulness constraint targets segments in that context.
    - Common contexts where contrast is preserved: stressed syllables, initial syllables, onsets: all contexts that are perceptually salient.
- Preservation of voicing in onsets could be captured by the constraint below:
    - <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ident-onset</span>-([voice]) </br> Let Y be an output segment in the onset, and X the corresponding input segment. Assign one violation if Y is [αvoice] and X is not [αvoice].
- Let's work this out for some hypothetical inputs:
    + /bad/ → [bat]
    + /bad-e/ → [bade]
    + /gat/ → [gat]
    + /gat-e/ → [gate]
    + We can also pursue an alternative analysis using a context-specific markedness constraint like <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">\*Coda-voice</span>.
- Could we use positional faithfulness for the case of neutralization in intervocalic voicing? Let's sketch an analysis.

# Lexicon optimization
- Does Richness of the Base mean anything can be in underlying representations?
    + In theory, yes -- there are no hard limits on URs.
- Does Richness of the Base mean underlying representations in a language include everything?
    + For an actual language, no -- learners won't posit "weird" or "crazy" URs without evidence.
- Prince & Smolensky (1993/2004) suggest a learning procedure called **Lexicon Optimization**.
    + For a given phonetic form, the chosen UR will be the one that maps onto the SR with the fewest violation of highest-ranked constraints.
    + In the absence of aleternations, learners will pick a UR that gives a mapping minimizing the violation of faithfulness constraints: the UR matches the SR.
    + This runs contrary to the idea that we should minimize the number of underlying sounds in a language, and it especially runs contrary to the usage of abstract phonemes to minimize the number of underlying sounds.
- An example: imagine a non-alternating phonological property -- like the aspiration of initial [kʰ] in [kʰæt] in English.
    -  The correct grammar for English will ensure the surface occurrence of [kʰ] in [kʰæt] no matter whether [kʰ] or [k] is present underlyingly.
    -  The advantage of the mapping /kʰæt/ ➞ [kʰæt] over /kæt/ ➞ [kæt] is that the former avoids a faithfulness violation, e.g. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ident</span>([spread glottis]).
    -  So learners will posit the mapping /kʰæt/ ➞ [kʰæt].
    -  Non-alternating phonological properties will always be present in URs.
