Ling 531A â€“ Fall 19 - Smith

# Course overview
- This course
	- The big idea in this course is **phonological argumentation**: how to evaluate, compare, and apply phonological models.
	- We'll practice **iterative model development**, building a model to accomplish some goals, testing it with new data, revising, and repeating.
	- We'll focus primarily on **Optimality Theory**, a framework that emerged in the early 1990s and replaced rules with constraints.
- Syllabus
	- Course overview, goals, requirements
	- Handouts and schedule
		- The schedule is very flexible.
		- Handouts usually span multiple class meetings.
		- This handout is exceptionally long and detailed.
	- Laptops, Slack, and Google docs
- To print or not to print?
	- Handouts are viewable on electronic devices, and I'll post the websites on Slack.
	- Trivia: Handouts are typeset using [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). 
		- I actually use [MultiMarkdown](https://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/), which is basically Github-flavored Markdown with some nice extensions (especially headerless tables!).
		- The raw code underlying every handout is available at a near-identical URL: replace `.html` with `.txt`.
		- The arcane and hacky CSS is [viewable](bws.css) if you're a masochist and/or web development enthusiast.
- For next time, think of as  many answers as possible to the questions below.
	-   "What are other possible goals of phonological theory?"
	-   "What are phonological data?"
